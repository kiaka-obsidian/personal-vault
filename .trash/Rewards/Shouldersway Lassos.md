## Notes
Its a &quot;prepare&quot; step but only once
On Lassoos Men let go of the ladies hand on the soulder
Facing &quot;stage&quot; on 1/2 beat
Timing is horrible here - be careful of beat checks
Always stepping back (men and ladies) on right foot
Don&#x27;t say &quot;pull down on the L hand&quot;
This is a final move
** Stay in lanes - the men can move backwards as ladies turn to men stay in a straight line
