I heat up, I can't cool down  
You got me spinning  
'Round and 'round  
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes  
Where it stops nobody knows

Every time you call my name  
I heat up like a burning flame  
Burning flame full of desire  
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher

Abra abracadabra  
I wanna reach out and grab ya  
Abra abracadabra  
Abracadabra

You make me hot, you make me sigh  
You make me laugh, you make me cry  
Keep me burning for your love  
With the touch of a velvet glove

Abra abracadabra  
I wanna reach out and grab ya  
Abra abracadabra  
Abracadabra

I feel the magic in your caress  
I feel magic when I touch your dress  
Silk and satin, leather and lace  
Black panties with an angel's face

I see magic in your eyes  
I hear the magic in your sighs  
Just when I think I'm gonna get away  
I hear those words that you always say

Abra abracadabra  
I wanna reach out and grab ya  
Abra abracadabra  
Abracadabra

Every time you call my name  
I heat up like a burning flame  
Burning flame full of desire  
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher  
Yeah, yeah

I heat up, I can't cool down  
My situation goes 'round and 'round  
I heat up, I can't cool down  
My situation goes 'round and 'round  
I heat up, I can't cool down  
My situation goes 'round and 'round

I heat up (I heat up), I can't cool down (can't cool down)  
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('round and 'round)  
I heat up (I heat up), I can't cool down (can't cool down)  
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('round and 'round)  
I heat up, I heat up (can't cool, can't cool down)
