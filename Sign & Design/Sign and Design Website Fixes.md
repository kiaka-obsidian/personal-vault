	- Can determine any pages that google can not see and why

##### Website
- Broken social links (in footer and sidebar menu)
- Page Tabs - Missing clearer info
- Page Descriptions
	- https://www.sign-design.uk/projects/ (right click the page in the browser and view page source)
	- ```"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor amet artisan thundercats tattooed, gochujang VHS post-ironic\nwhatever ramps hell of before they sold out freegan meh pinterest cray.\nMumblecore authentic iPhone craft beer.

	- ^ this appears on a few pages, and is also in the social media share description
- Possibly embed instagram somewhere, if you post content there a lot, then show it off (will require more work and might not fit right but is an idea)
	- https://behold.so/guides/how-to-embed-an-instagram-feed-on-your-website/#embed-an-instagram-profile
- First view of the page with no scolling
	- "For all of your signage requirements."
	- Could it be more visual and appealing to pull people in
- As much as it wont appeal, check out your competitors and see what they have on their websites.  Think of the content, the flow the user takes and features that would make someone click, engage and get in touch
