seen physio this morning
nicola (^)

next time, emergency plan to talk and prepare 

community/district nurse, link to GP, meds and other support 
- 24/7 service - important number and contact
- GP will be called incase of emergency
- info about possible hospices
	- all palliative care units family can stay. as well
- GP has a palliative care nurse too (mum mentioned)

do you need care and help
- getting help in the morning
- twice a day
- just tell district nurse if more help is needed
	- give some warning and heads up

apply for funding on our behalf, paperwork is already done
	care can be at home
	or 27 hour somewhere
	being sent off

occupational therapist
- chair lift
- pendant/wrist alarm
- lock boxes
comode downstairs as well

food - focus nutrition, ask a dietitian, drink supplement (milkshake type of thing)
- something to be careful around types of lard

financial aid
- attendance help, they will find out about that, get a special form to fil that out
- they will help with that
- can take some time to come through, but they will sort the forms out (specialist nurse will find out)

adhoc on helping leaving house and getting out, visits can be canceled as well to say we will be heading out

as things progress adding additional layers of help might be enough to provide help for the whole family
