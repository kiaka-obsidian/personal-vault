1 Year Married today... I would never have believed I'd get married at all, let alone to someone as amazing as you.  Over the last year you have made me the happiest husband ever.  The ring on my finger never felt so right, and to be placed there by you a year ago today.

I can still close my eyes and see you coming down the isle, dressed in white, big smile on your face. Holding your hands in front of friends and family as we say our vows to each other.

From that day I promised to make you the happiest women in the world, and you have ended up making me the happiest man.  Each day when I wake up next to you, till we fall asleep holding each others hand, you make smile, and feel more loved then I ever have before.

And now we have a (not so little any more) fur baby making me the proudest dad ever.  I am so happy to have started this family with you, and look forward to all the joys it will bring

You have my heart, for ever and always.
