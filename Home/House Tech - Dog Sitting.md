### Circuit Breaker
To the right of the Front door is where the circuit breaker box is located.  In the event of a power outage/circuit trip open this box and flip the tripped switch back.  If the circuit keeps tripping get in touch with us.

### Heating
The house is connected with a hive heating box that is located upstairs on the landing opposite the bedrooms
If you are wanting to have the heating turned on press the right button located on the top of the box for a 30 min heating boost.  The house warms up quickly so it wont need very long to heat up. To stop the boost press the return (bottom left button, looks like arrow) to cancel the heating boost
