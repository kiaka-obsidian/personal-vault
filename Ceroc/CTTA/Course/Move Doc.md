A document for notes about different styles of moves and how to teach them and class structure.

**Not all notes included in this are needed to be mentioned in a single class.**

In-fact you **will** **not** have enough time to mention them all. 

So, keep it in mind :D

|                        | Don’t overload (put something at least)                                                               |
|                        | Maybe do a spin teach here if it is relevant                                                          |
|                        | Maybe do a Slotting Teach here if it is relevant - face stage to show the slot the follows travel on  |
|                        | Turn and face sometimes to show the style to the class                                                |
|                        | Flow can be the strength of a lead                                                                    |
|                        | This move has a lovely flow and you can do this by just keep moving (demo before teach 3)             |
| &lt; Timing >          | "Moves on 1/2 beats" - Show Slowly "1 and 2" - Re-Show quicker - Count in and get class involved      |
|                        | Go through move like normal till the timing point - carry on the move after getting class involved    |
|                        | No preceding teaches mention 1/2 beats                                                                |
|                        | If running out of time can incorporate it into the beat check                                         |
| &lt; Beat Check >      | usual beat check                                                                                      |
|                        | if there is 1/2 beats - say "step and step" YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SAY ONE AND TWO (OR NUMBERS!!!!)   |
|                        | Step and Step and back on beat X                                                                      |
|                        | Think photos - X on beat 1 (pause(snap)) Y on beat 2 (pause(snap))                                    |
| &lt; Count >           | Depends - is it complex, might do one                                                                 |

## General Notes (no order, structure, or rhyme/reason to what I wrote down)

don’t say unwrap the ladies - say turn the ladies out

Sometimes you need to explain a more complicated step twice (aka walkarounds)

When describing where the ladies are going to move you can change the wording to \
Men when you do X you will find that this will make/allow/encourage the ladies do Y

remember on Basket and other moves to step off the slot

Sometimes a twist is not a twist - step backwards

On wording SAY SOMETHING

there are many top tips that can be said - and a lot are generic

Demo maybe at the end (allowing you to adjust the routine if needed, and not scare people off)

Core over arse - keep upright

SLOTTING - if you don’t need to come back in the way of the slot - stay out of the way

Don’t have to break down the motion of a walk out of a move "men lead the ladies forward, then pull down with X to bring your partner round to face"

Stop doing middle finger leads

Can say shape/feel is just "This is a nice simple move" to describe it

No need to say "drive" (your not - it’s a body lead)

Mambo frame teach (Explain hand hold, ladies arm on M shoulder, M place hand around L shoulder - Mambo FW) \
Maybe do it twice if someone on the side might need to have a practice of it

Can also add throw-away tips during Teach 1

Frame Tension

Clock face - superimposed on the dance floor OR in front of you (facing you) \
e.g. Followers back on 6 o'clock

Always a bend in the elbows

INT CLASS - could do a 4-5 moves around a theme (musicality, shoulder sway)

THEME - Move has a great connection with partner

Cross Road - ladies up and down road - men across the road

1 – 4 -7 

* 1 - 4 - 7 tension - on lead away - 
* 0 no contact
* 10 - step back and add a lot of weight
* 4 find a happy half way
* Add up to 7 on tension and release or bring up higher if needing more control

Hand around shoulder - let go with hand on any possible boob touching

Ladies - keep moving until you are stopped (step back) sometimes when the flow is easier to teach when movement is coming in

Slot teach - do it facing the crowd 

Lean - 

* Ladies keep right leg straight 
* Men don’t bend hips
* Men let go with right hand - espesh for smaller ladies
* Men hand on lean on pocket
* Ladies hand on lean can go over
* Men on step to side don’t take the knee over the foot on weight

**Be selective of details - don’t put too much details into the teach \
e.g. switches or health & safety on a lean (give one detail for the ladies)**

Remember - Both Step In

Position checks (turn and face the audience)

Hand shape

1. Ladies thumb down, middle finger slightly down (to shape into mens arm when in frame
2. Men thumb up with hand - middle finer slightly down (not a paddle)

Style - get your demo to take part - Be infront of demo for them to mirror

Style - if in hold let the demo do the style (not teacher) \
Can be out of hold the teacher as well

Hand style - maybe don’t mention credit card as ladies might just put the fingers together \
or if mention egg they might bend the fingers

If mentioning clock face give some details

Learn your clockwise and anti-clockwise 

LEAD - 90%/95% is body lead

Frame - Men bend hand down - will bring arm up \
Ladies push the shoulder (engage) into men’s hand

Comedy/Empathy - When I used to do was x - what I learned to-do was to 

1/2 beats - step and step **YOU DO NOT NOW KNOW HOW TO USE NUMBERS PROPPERLY HERE**

If men are moving along the ladies’ slot, (Shouldersway Lassos) men can move backwards facing the lady’s final direction

COMEDY - come prepared with something so it becomes a little more natural and amusing

If Taxi's are around at the start, show them the Int routines

Prep a week ahead - and use the week ahead to prepare/test If the move works and what to make notes of

Connection explanation - Leaders hand down, palm uup - follows hands over - can lead the partner around without any hand hold

When explaing the fix on an issue use positive comments - *NOT* ladies as you step in don’t turn/anticipate

Sway (with/without shoulder) pull down and raise (scoop)

Eyes up when dancing

STORY - think of changing the start and end

Catapult style moves - 7o'clock prepare then pull down and raise (might not have time to teach it)

"REVERSE TEACHING

Teach the last move first

Example Travel whip slingshot - teach the slingshot first, then add the whip and finish with travel return

Sometimes will work - will just know (somehow)"

Nothing wrong with resetting part way through a move and re-doing it all together

SLINGSHOT - remember take body back (pivot on right foot)

There is nothing wrong with adding an extra beat if you as the teacher struggles or you know the class will struggle

Travel return in replacement of normal return (make sure not a over change of place

HIGH FIRST - no longer to shoulder in int - easier and feels better

DANCE TECHNIQUE - relax!!!! Connection requires virtually no tension

DANCE TECHNIQUE - time with the music

KEEP IT SIMPLE, KEEP IT SDUPID - a simple routine is perfectly ok to teach

FEET – 5 to 1 – remember where my feet are turned into


## Seducer – Level 1


### LEADERS

* Collect Ladies in-front
    * Right hand on Ladies far (Left) hip
    * Left hand on Ladies spine (centre of back) between Ladies shoulder-blade
    * Ladies feet (side by side) in line with Mens right foot
    * Back straight (etc)
* Seducer
    * Large lunge to Left (Ladies step back should be in middle of feet)
    * Left leg bent – right leg straight
        * Left knee has not gone over foot
    * Straight out to the side, not in-front or behind
    * Ladies collected into Mens right side


### FOLLOWS

* Collect Ladies in-front
    * Feet side by side
    * Avoid anticipation
* Seducer
    * Back on right foot – small step – ends up between (in-front) Mens legs
    * Right knee bent – left leg straight
    * Keep knees together
    * Ladies in mens right side
    * **Style** – arm out (still at 10o’clock) head tilted looking at hand (see Level 2 for more)
    * Right hand/arm either
        * Hooked around men
        * Over mens left shoulder


### Pre-Teach

* Separate Lead and Follow Teach
    * Face class – get men to face stage – seduce to (my right classes left) to show footwork
    * Demo with Ladies – showing step and back (maintain weight) etc
* Go straight into the middle (seducer part) of the move
    * Men face the stage – ladies feet together in-front of mens right foot facing far wall
    * Men raise right arm – ladies take right arm around X
    * MRH on LRShoulder, MLH on LLHip
    * **Move around 90° showing positions to class**
    * All together – lunge left men – ladies back on right foot (maybe walk away from demo showing Ladies having own weight


### Rest of the story

* Don’t have a high first precede this move with the arm up high
* Keep in mind complexity of the move
* (e.g.) Traveling return redirect (MRH on LLHip to prevent finishing movement
* (e.g.) Exit slingshot 




## Seducer – Level 2

### Etiquette

* Prep Beat is required by insurance (don’t tell class this)
* Men there is always a prep prior to seduce lunge – is required
* Ladies – there is a prep step – do not anticipate going straight into a Seduce/Dip/Drop
* Men ask Ladies prior to Seduce/Dip/Drop if they are comfortable with them
    * Never assume anyone is
    * Never assume they still are (circumstances change)
    * Don’t ask ½ a second or during dip
        * This can be a good comedic point to demo, asking demo “are you ok with me doing a seducer” whilst performing the seducer


### Followers

* Need to push Right foot into the ground – not toes
    * Will shift their weight the wrong direction
* Lift left foot heel (twist heel/or sole of foot, towards partner)
    * Will trigger a corkscrew effect pushing balance towards Lead (not away)
* Ladies have the choice of variation (different ways of performing the seduce)
    * Leaders have no control here – just assume seduce and move the same way
* **Style** – arm extend out to the side
    * on seduce its still out to the side at 10o’clock – turn head to look at hand
    * Shoulder -> Elbow -> Wrist – DON’T take the whole arm out at once
* If not stepped back at all or enough will end up with the Left foot/leg going up
* Back on right foot to keep left leg straight – style
    * It is not wrong to go back on the left – will work the same way


### Leaders



* Weight might shift L to R **(? – play with this and see where it feels right)**
    * Weight on Right foot on prep
    * Step and shift weight




## Mambo


### Footwork (TBC)



* Toe – Ball – Heel 


## Walkthrough


### Leaders



* Tilt hand down – bring arm up


## Pathway Teach 

This is part of the pre-teach (e.g. high-hand)


### Footwork (part 1)



* (e.g.) Walking around ladies


### Hand work (part2)



* Leaders do something with your hand
    * Drawing hand between partner whilst


### Ladies (part 3)



* (e.g) Turning feet together x (and a ½) times
* Leaders stay out of the way


## Arm Roll

Never lead with the lead with the arm rolling the hold

Mention no leading on the arm roll




## Whips 


### Pre-Teach

**See video that Rob recorded**


### Teaching Notes

* Blocking on shoulder
* Ladies settle into the shoulder (push the shoulder back)
* Ladies take a small step backwards (shoulder prevents over stepping)
    * Men keeping arm close (in-front) to block the ladies from stepping
* Men – 
    * Stepping to 8o’clock with left foot (body weight heading backwards)
    * If ladies have momentum step to 9o’clock (optional)
    * If don’t want ladies to move step to 10o’clock (optional)
* Men stepping across Ladies slot on beat 3 (not half) 
* Men as pulling ladies through ladies come sideways to face partner
* Men turn head to look in direction ladies are traveling
    * This will turn the body early (and produce the whip)
* Ladies frame (push back) arm over keeping connection
    * Remember hand/fingers push into mens arm (over top)


### Core fundamentals

1. Must block early
    1. Partner will over
2. Must step away
3. Must step on the main beat
4. Follow push shoulder blade
5. (optional) Lead - Look over shoulder


### Style & Flow

**See second video**

Using mambo to explain leading ladies’ forwards and back I want to move my body to lead (just see the video)


## Reverse Teach

REVERSE TEACHING

Teach the last move first

Example Travel whip slingshot - teach the slingshot first, then add the whip and finish with travel return

Sometimes will work - will just know (somehow)


## Follow fundamentals

**Richard to send a video**

During beginner’s class walked through all moves twice through 

Try for all three or just focus on the one (and see how that goes)

Break out “Follows there are three (take hand up) fundamentals that we would like you get whilst you dance.  We are going to do this again but this time with the fundamentals”

Slow down voice as stepping back – use arms as visuals

“Fundamental number 1, **wait with your weight over the back foot** (meat on the bone) what that means is your weight should be back on your foot (do basics)”

“Fundamental number 2 (walking on the slotting)”

“Fundamental number 3 turn or spin with feet close together (obv not completely together) when ever feet close together ... means turns will keep you on the slot and end facing partner (? Not sure if right)”

Carry on walking through focusing on the follows pointing out (not stopping momentum) on the fundamentals

Then onto music


## Slotted teaching



* Teach stage to back of the room
* Think of three lanes – two outside lanes
* Keep it short and sweet
* Try to add a slotted teach at least once per class
* Keep it on end of move one / start of move two
    * NOT move three


## Cross Steps



* Walking along a tight rope
* Men
    * Body Lead – don’t push and pull (or drive)
* Ladies
    * Waling down a tight rope
    * Feet should maintain 5 to 1 turn 


## Routine Construction

IF YOU CAN NOT MAKE A ROUTINE IN 20 MIN – IT MIGHT BE TOO COMPLICATED

Do a Monthly review – this will help improve the routines you plan allowing a point to work out what went well and didn’t

Plan a couple weeks ahead and dance them in the weeks before in freestyle to learn what worked might work – think Level of move and Links

Ok to use an existing beginner move and add something extra \
E.g. a double turnout

Perfectly ok to repeat a move a few weeks later



* “I’ve had a request to repeat this move”
    * No one will have a clue no one requested it
* People wont remember last weeks routine let alone 3 weeks later


![[Routine Best Practice.jpeg]]


### Move of the Month

Don’t announce the move of the month if you do it – if someone doesn’t like the move you have chosen they may decide to not come along for the next few weeks

Has the disadvantage of the last routine & Move of the month being very hard and putting a new Int dancer off

Move of the month doesn’t have to get harder – could be variations of the move at roughly the same level (or add special style/instructions to make the move appear harder)


### Special Classes

**(not ready for this yet, but keep in mind as the year goes on)**

Themed Fun class will contain very little (or no) technique and style



* Also ok to repeat
* Very much ok to plagiarise someone else’s routine (but give credit where credit is due)

—-

nothing here for others

Lock steps

Men forward left foot

Take weight over and behind left foot with right foot

Upper body will twist a little

It is not a ballroom lock step where lock steps are hidden right behind foot 

Ladies go with it or you will fall over

Frame is vital
