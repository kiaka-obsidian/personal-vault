Rocking Around the Christmas Tree

---

- Basic Change Of palcec x2

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  

- In and arms boath out

- Left Arm round and up above, shake on see
Mistletoe hung where you can see  

- Turn L, Turn M, Spot to shoulder on stop

Every couple tries to stop  

- Inside First
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear  
Voices singing, let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancin' merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear  
Voices singing, let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
