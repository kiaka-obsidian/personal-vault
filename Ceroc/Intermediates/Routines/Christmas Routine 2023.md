Rocking Around the Christmas Tree

---

- Basic Change Of palces x2
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  

- In and arms both out, Wiggle after Hop
At the Christmas party hop  


- Left Arm round and up above, (shake on see)
Mistletoe hung where you can see  

- Turn Ladies - Block on stop
Every couple tries to stop  

- Basic Change of place x2
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  

- NeckWrap
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  

- Rock Side to side
And we'll do some caroling

- Ice skating Left, right, left, right ,left hold - Hands to ear on "you hear" 
You will get a sentimental feeling 
- Turn to face each other - Hands to ear on "you hear" 
	when you hear  

- Men collect Ladies Left arm with right As ladies slowly turn
Voices singing, let's be jolly  

- Men bring arms low into haliluha
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  

back to the beginning
