Rocking Around the Christmas Tree

---

- Basic Change Of palces x2
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  

- In and arms both out, Wiggle after Hop
At the Christmas party hop  


- Left Arm round and up above, (shake on see)
Mistletoe hung where you can see  

- Turn Ladies
Every couple tries to stop  

- Inside First Repeat
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  

Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear  
Voices singing, let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancin' merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear  
Voices singing, let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
