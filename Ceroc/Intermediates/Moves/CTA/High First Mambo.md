## Notes
Pre Teach - Mambo frame teach (Explain hand hold, ladies arm on M shoulder, M place hand around L shoulder - Mambo FW)
Starts &amp; Ends like beginners High First
Ballroom hold on B2
Maybe donâ€™t take arm to the shoulder as the follows will want to stay on their slot and taking the hand to the shoulder will make them step off it
